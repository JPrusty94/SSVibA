# SSVibA
Sandwich Shell Vibration Analysis 

Vibration analysis of sandwich shells with cut-outs using artificial intelligence methods

This Matlab application is designed to compute the non-dimensional natural frequencies and modal loss factors for a doubly curved sandwich shell with a cut-out. The sandwich shell consists of two aluminum face layers and a natural rubber core. The user can choose the geometry of the shell structure—cylindrical, spherical, or hyperbolic—and specify boundary conditions, such as CFFF, CFCF, or CCCC. Additionally, they can configure cutout parameters, including the shape of the cutout, its normalized coordinates, and its normalized size.

For calculating the eigenproperties of the sandwich shell, SSVibA uses only feedforward Artificial Neural Networks, which have been trained on an extensive training dataset taken from experimental modal analysis and FEA analysis.

Install this app by using the "APPS" tab of the Matlab window -> "Install App" then select the mlappinstall file of this repository.

Users are encouraged to provide feedback regarding the use or improvement of this application.
