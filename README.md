# SSVibA
Sandwich Shell Vibration Analysis 

Vibration analysis of sandwich shells using artificial intelligence methods

This Matlab application calculates the non-dimensional natural frequencies and modal loss factors of a cylindrical sandwich shell containing two face layers of aluminium and a core layer of natural rubber. The user can select the boundary conditions of the shell structure and the cutout configurations, such as the shape of the cut-out, the normalized coordinates of the position of the cutout and the normalized size of the cutout.

For the calculation of the eigenproperties of the sandwich shell SSVibA uses only feedforward Artificial Neural Networks, which have been trained on an extensive training dataset taken from FEA analyses.

Install this app by using the "APPS" tab of the Matlab window -> "Install App" then select the mlappinstall file of this repository.

Users are encouraged to provide feedback regarding the use or improvement of this application.
